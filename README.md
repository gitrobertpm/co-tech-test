Test SPA for Coalition Tech

Using the `CT_SkillTest_v3.psd` file in the `img` folder as a guide, I built a single page site for my Coalition Tech dev challenge.

Bootstrap was used for the carousel and navigation elements, but the rest is just vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.

I don't have Photoshop, so I used Affinity Designer to view the `psd` file, which meant there were no HTML or CSS to export. So I built this site from scratch using only the mockup as an example.

I have a suspicion that the `psd` file may render differently in Affinity Designer than it might in Photoshop. So if the end result is not what you were expecting, that may be why.

You can see what I was working with in the `Screenshot-psd-file-in-AD.jpg` screenshot in the `img` folder.
